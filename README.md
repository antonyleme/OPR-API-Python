OpenPage Rank API Python3 request

The original request example given by the API in their website is in PHP but some people may need to use it in python (my case). So I made a python3 request for using in my project. 

For use you just have to put your API KEY and change the domain you want. 

The right way to do it is using the python urlencode to the domains but I faced some problems with it. When I use urlencode the responde i receive is that no domains were given. So if anyone fix it, feel free to commit. I would be thankful.
